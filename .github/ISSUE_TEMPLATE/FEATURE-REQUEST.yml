        ### How to Use This DoD with Your Kanban Columns:

        * **Todo (Backlog):** When an issue is created or picked up, this DoD checklist is part of the issue.
        * **In Development:** The developer works on the task, aiming to satisfy the relevant DoD items.
        * **Testing:** Automated tests run; manual testing by another developer/QA. CI/CD pipeline passes on feature branch.
        * **Code Review:** PR submitted, reviewed, and feedback addressed.
        * **Done:** All DoD checkboxes are ticked, branch merged to `develop`, CI passes on `develop`, card moved.

        **Note on Merging to `main`:**
        This DoD focuses on getting a task "Done" and integrated into your `develop` branch. The process of merging from `develop` to `main` can be considered a separate step, potentially part of a release process.
